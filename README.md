# play-store-gx
PlayStoreGX, Allows you to download apps straight from the google play store onto your windows device without and emulator or subsystem for linux. No Hustle* Just Download" you can acess it on this link https://smokev4.github.io/play-store-gx/

HOW TO INSTALL-----

-> MAKE SURE YOUR REAL TIME PROTECTION ON WINDOWS IS SET TO OFF. WHY?
   - BECAUSE WE USE AN ONLINE SERVICE THAT INJECTS INTO THE EXE TO EMULATE THE PLAY STORE EXPERIENCE. WINDOWS WILL THINK THAT THE ONLINE SERVICE INJECTING INTO PLAY STORE 
     IS A VIRUS AND IT WILL BLOCK THE FILE.
     
-> TURN ON DEVELOPER MODE
   - YOU WILL NEED DEVELOPER MODE ON IN ORDER TO RUN THE PLAY STORE ( GO TO SEARCH BAR AND TYPE DEVELOPER MOD SETTINGS, ENABLE DEV MODE)
   
-> INSTALL THE EXE FILE.
   - NOW INSTALL THE FILE AND RUN IT SO IT CAN INSTALL THE DEPENDENCIES AND START PLAY STORE. IF CHROME BLOCKS IT THEN GO INTO SECURITY IN CHROME AND SET PROTECTION TO OFF.
   WHY? BECAUSE CHROME ALSO THINKS IT'S A VIRUS WHEN IT IS NOT( BECAUSE WE USE ONLINE SERVICE TO INJECT AND STORE DATA INTO THE APP)
   
-> ERROR'S AND HOW TO FIX
   - ERROR WINDOWS X40400 - this error happens because the app fails to turn on the reg files (virtual machine platform / windows subsystem for linux)
      to fix go to search bar on windows and search -TURN WINDOWS FEATURES ON AND OFF-
      now click on it and search for virtual machine platform and windows subsystem for linux
      now tick both options and click OK
      it may or may not tell you to restart computer but if it does just restart computer.
